Monte Carlo simulations of coarse-grained polymers: Metropolis, Wang-Landau for Flexible and Semiflexible chains

A long overdue push to git, polymermc contains source code used to simulate both flexible and semiflexible homopolymer chains. A single chain can be simulated using the Metropolis algorithm or the Wang-Landau algorithm. Results have been published here:
